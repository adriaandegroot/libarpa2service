====================================================

DoNAI Selector formal syntax.

The grammar for a DoNAI Selector is given below, described in Augmented Backus-
Naur Form (ABNF) as documented in [RFC5234].


donaisel       = [ localstring ] "@" domsel

localstring    = 1*( localchar / "+" )

domsel         = 1*( localchar )

localchar      = basechar / "."      ; excluding "@" and "+"

basechar       = %x21-2A /           ; all visible (printing) characters, except
                 %x2C-2D /           ; SPACE " ", DOT ".", AT "@", PLUS "+"
                 %x2F-3F /
                 %x41-7E
